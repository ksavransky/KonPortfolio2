# My Portfolio

Ideas:

I. Menu

I like his use of a logo with his name. Do it similar to BrightPlan menu and burger in terms of layout and logo positioning.

I like Denises's menu's functionality -- the smooth scrolling. Have social media links LinkedIn and Git only on right like her. 

II. Photo of me and tagline

Hi, my name is Kon. I'm a Full Stack Developer. I love to code, have strong leadership and business sense, and a knack for design. I'm ready to help your team build a great application.

My Photo surrounded by stuff I know. Eyes following.

III. Projects

I like Denise's approach with the modal and the link in the modal and a larger description.
Do resizing like in BrightPlan, where modal takes up whole screen once hits a certain breakpoint.

IV. Blog (later?)

V. Contact Me

I like his form. But I'm thinking I put it in a modal to be consistent with the above re projects section. I.e. don't switch urls.

VI. Recommendations (later?)
